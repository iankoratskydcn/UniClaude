Claude Code, natively inside Unity Editor. A dockable chat window with full project awareness, 60+ MCP tools, and zero alt-tabbing — all powered by your Claude subscription.

## Features

- **Editor chat window** — dockable panel with streaming responses, dark/light theme, and conversation history
- **Project awareness** — UniClaude indexes your scenes, prefabs, scripts, shaders, and ScriptableObjects so Claude understands your project structure
- **60+ Unity tools** — Claude can inspect and modify scenes, prefabs, components, materials, animations, tags, layers, and project settings through the MCP protocol — all with full Undo integration
- **Model selection** — choose between Sonnet, Opus, and Haiku with configurable reasoning effort (Low → Max)
- **File & image attachments** — attach project files and screenshots directly in the chat input
- **Permission system** — every tool call requires explicit approval (allow once, allow for session, or deny)
- **Slash commands** — extensible command system with autocomplete (`/healthcheck`, `/clear`, `/export`, and more)
- **Diff viewer** — review script edits in a colored diff popup (green/red lines) without leaving UniClaude
- **Settings panel** — configurable font size, Node.js path, sidecar port, context token budget, and package filtering
- **Ninja Install Mode** — optional embedded-clone install that hides UniClaude from `git status` and `packages-lock.json` on team projects. Reversible from Settings.
- **Version tracker** — Settings tab surfaces new releases from GitHub once a day, with inline changelog preview and one-click update (mode-aware for Ninja and Standard installs).
- **MCP server** — JSON-RPC 2.0 server that exposes Unity editor actions to any MCP-compatible client
- **Domain reload resilience** — survives Unity's domain reload cycle with automatic reconnection
